# ComixEd
An application for managing digital comics.

## Overview And Goals
ComixEd is designed to be a digital comics manager. It will:

 * import your existing and new digital comics
 * organize your comics under a single directory
 * allow you to view and edit the details of the comic	
 * search your comic library by comic details
 * identify, and delete, duplicate pages across comics
 * provide access to your library from a variety of applications

Paired with an application that can read your comics (such as
[Chunky Reader](http://chunkyreader.com/)) you will have a very powerful
and useful solution for reading your comic collection.

## Supported Comic Formats

The following digital comic formats are supported:

 * CBZ (ZIP)
 * CBR (RAR)
 * CB7 (7ZIP)

## Running The Application

The project is broken up into two parts:
1. the Java backend, and
1. the Angular web frontend.

### The Java Backend

The backend needs to have a few lines of configuration setup.

#### application.properties

The two main entries that need to be setup are:

    configuration.filename=C:/Users/comics/comixedrc
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:C:/Users/comics/comixed;create=true

The *configurtion.filename* entry tells the application where to find the persisted configuration for the application.

The *spring.datasource.url* entry tells the application where the database is location, and the *create=true* portion tells it to create the database file if it's not found.

#### Running the backend

To start the backend, launch it from the command line with:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

### Interacting With The Application

To connect to the web application, point a browser to *http://localhost:7171/index.html*.

You can then log into the application with one of two default accounts:

1. **Administrator** username=comixedadmin@localhost password=comixedadmin
1. **Reader** username=comixedreader@localhost password=comixedreader
